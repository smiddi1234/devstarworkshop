Fortunately, one of our companions is a spy, Tom Kurious, and have managed to sneak into the Alien War Ship. During our missions, he will report valueable information that might help us bring down the Alien War Ship!

## How to play ##

#### Objective ####

By developing space fighters (microservices) in either Java, Node.js or PHP, you will complete missions in order to defeat the Alien War Ship. The missions will be explained in the instructions, but you can't complete some of the missions without valuable information from the spy.

#### Squads ####

You work together in squads with the common goal to defeat the Alien War Ship. A squad can consist of any number of members and skill level. When someone in the squad completes a mission on behalf of the squad, the mission will be deemed completed for the entire squad. This means that if another squad member completes the same mission, it will not give extra points.

## Scoring ##

The points are obtained as your squad completes the missions. The sooner your team completes a mission, the more points you will get. But don't worry, also the last squad to complete a mission will give valuable damage to the Alien War Ship.
